Hi!

This is my Pet project dedicated to automated testing on such a framework WebdriverIO with Cucumber.

Here I am testing the www.booking.com website, which is a web application for booking apartments and hotels Worldwide.

In this project I am implement the Page Object pattern with Helpers and Utils.

As a report I choose the Allure report,I liked it because it clearly and beautifully shows detailed statistics in the form of graphs. Also, in case of failure, he attaches a screenshot. And it stores the entire history with triggered parameters. If desired, you can set the severity and so on...

In addition, I used pre/post to run the scripts.

The next thing I want to do is set up CI

Thank you !
